<TEXT><![CDATA[ï»¿The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.

He is now aware of the safety deposit, and I have informed him that I am locating one of my husband's business associates (you) to handle the funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed to our decision if he found out that I barely know you.

The Group operations are based in Xiamen, South of China, which is the largest export and import business portals in China where Wanlistone owns and operates various natural stone deposits with 6,000 square meters through the country.

I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims, as this is my primary objective.

The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 

I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work featured on trading cards, prints and in magazines.

My late client has an account is valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only.

This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person nor by correspondence.

It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.

As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. 

This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land, which hamper agriculture, which is our major source of livelihood. 

My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. 

I do not know your person but I am relying on faith to see me through.

I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money to our selves, they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that it's no problem.

Blackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded my husband's house on April 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm in Macheke/Virginia district and murdered him because of his insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain their farmlands despite the  recently introduced land reforms"Act" in Zimbabwe by he head of state,President Robert Mugabe.

On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife And  their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagbama Express Road.

In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "SOS" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future.

I am waiting for your quick response. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this transaction will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim.

The Rehabilitation of the refinery have been completed and after the contractor has paid, the access of money (in cash) was kept with a security/finance company.

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.

CONGRATULATIONS! Your fund is now deposited with the paying Bank.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you.

For every transaction, we pay 8 % from the total sum.

Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLIAMABLE " and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the
course of war in Africa and the world in general.

This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.

This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for.

I managed to move the box containing the money out of Iraq through diplomatic immunity to a Security company in London , U.K  and the box is been deposited as family treasure, for security reasons.

It wouldnt cost you any amount,you are to receive payments which will be sent by my customers to you via fedex.

We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members.

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option.

All occupants of the  vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

I would be contented to have your private contact for security reasons and I am very optimistic to release a reasonable percentage of this amount to you for your assistance.

This amount to a total of (USD $ 40M) Forty Million United State Dollars. The amount of money in my country due to my position in the government such amount of money will course suspicion which may lead to my impeachment, that is why l need your Assistant.

Our products have been past test through Acts testing Labs(H.K.) Ltd, China light industry quality supervise testing center.

Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary.

This is part of our security protocol to avoid double claiming or unscrupulous acts by participants/nonparticipants of this program.

I will give more details about the proceedings of this transaction as soon as I receive your favorable reply.

My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm.

The products are high power, high capacity and long life, which deeply welcomed by home and foreign customers.

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe.

Based on this,I had to flee the country with my  two children and my only late husband personal assistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his personal assistant{PA}.

I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us.

This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers.

Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I am making this proposal to you as a reliable partner. 

After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit.

This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE.

That Is my problem now, My mother Is willing to give Seven Million USDOLLARS to the you if you will help the family.

And he also confided in me, last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.

Right now, I want you to help us in the following ways:

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided  to track his last name over the Internet, to locate  any member of his family hence I contacted you.

According to my father, my own mother Died when I was about six years of age, which means that I did not even know my mother very well.

This means that this money will be recalled to the federal Government treasury as unclaimed after this period, precisely within this first quater of this year.
