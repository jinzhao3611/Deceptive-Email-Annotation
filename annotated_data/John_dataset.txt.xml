My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .

I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us.

This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers.

Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland.

Hello Dear Chosen one, Please excuse me for all the inconveniences my mail could cause you.

I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala 
Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.

In your best interest to avoid mix up of numbers and names of any kind, we request that you keep the entire details of your award strictly from public notice until the process of transferring your claims has been completed, and your funds remitted to your account.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this matter.

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any oneapprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at theend of the day.

I am making this proposal to you as a reliable partner. 

After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit.

This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE.

That Is my problem now, My mother Is willing to give Seven Million USDOLLARS to the you if you will help the family.

And he also confided in me, last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.

Since then I  have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate  any of my clients extended relatives this has also  proved unsuccessful. 

Right now, I want you to help us in the following ways:

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided  to track his last name over the Internet, to locate  any member of his family hence I contacted you.

According to my father, my own mother Died when I was about six years of age, which means that I did not even know my mother very well.

This means that this money will be recalled to the federal Government treasury as unclaimed after this period, precisely within this first quater of this year.

3)You are going to procure admissions for us to continue our studies in one of the known university in your country.

Finally I want you to know that your ability to keep confidential information about this transaction is very important as all our hope for a better life depends on this money.

The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me.

In fact, earlier, many suppliers refused to work with us for the reason of bureaucracy that occurred then registration of legal documents were needed to transport equipment, or transfer money.

Upon receipt of your response, I shall furnish you with the next step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim to your account.]]></TEXT>
